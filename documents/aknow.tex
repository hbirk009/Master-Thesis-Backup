 I want to thank my supervisor Johan Alme for invaluable guidance and feedback while writing this thesis. I also want to thank Matthias Richter for his input regarding software design, which gave me insight into a topic that was unfamiliar to me.
 
 Being part of the ProtonCT project has been an exciting part of my studies. Being part of a larger project spanning several institutions was a fun and learning-rich experience, which I am grateful for. Working alongside Birger Olsen, Jakob Hauser, and Martin Eggen has been a delight and has taught me much about working as a team to create a product.

Thank you to my dear friends and peer students who have been with me for the last two years: Amalie, Bendik, Birger, Eirik, and Thomas. There was never a dull moment in the study hall, and there were always exciting conversations to partake in, whether academic or casual.

Finally, I want to thank my friends and family, who supported me during my studies. I am truly grateful for the fantastic people who have been with me and always believed in me. Thank you.
