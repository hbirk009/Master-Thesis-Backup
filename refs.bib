abstract = {Abstract Purpose: Currently, calculations of proton range in proton therapy patients are based on a conversion of CT Hounsfield units of patient tissues into proton relative stopping power. Uncertainties in this conversion necessitate larger proximal and distal planned target volume margins. Proton CT can potentially reduce these uncertainties by directly measuring proton stopping power. We aim to demonstrate proton CT imaging with complex porcine samples, to analyze in detail three-dimensional regions of interest, and to compare proton stopping powers directly measured by proton CT to those determined from x-ray CT scans. Methods: We have used a prototype proton imaging system with single proton tracking to acquire proton radiography and proton CT images of a sample of porcine pectoral girdle and ribs, and a pig's head. We also acquired close in time x-ray CT scans of the same samples and compared proton stopping power measurements from the two modalities. In the case of the pig's head, we obtained x-ray CT scans from two different scanners and compared results from high-dose and low-dose settings. Results: Comparing our reconstructed proton CT images with images derived from x-ray CT scans, we find agreement within 1\% to 2\% for soft tissues and discrepancies of up to 6\% for compact bone. We also observed large discrepancies, up to 40\%, for cavitated regions with mixed content of air, soft tissue, and bone, such as sinus cavities or tympanic bullae. Conclusions: Our images and findings from a clinically realistic proton CT scanner demonstrate the potential for proton CT to be used for low-dose treatment planning with reduced margins.},

    abstract = { Particle beams like protons and heavier ions offer improved dose distributions compared with photon (also called x-ray) beams and thus enable dose escalation within the tumor while sparing normal tissues. Although protons have a biologic effectiveness comparable to photons, ions, because they are heavier than protons, provide a higher biologic effectiveness. Recent technologic developments in the fields of accelerator engineering, treatment planning, beam delivery, and tumor visualization have stimulated the process of transferring particle radiation therapy (RT) from physics laboratories to the clinic. This review describes the physical, biologic, and technologic aspects of particle beam therapy. Clinical trials investigating proton and carbon ion RT will be summarized and discussed in the context of their relevance to recent concepts of treatment with RT. }

	journal = {Physics in Medicine and Biology},
	abstract = {The main advantages of proton therapy are the reduced total energy deposited in the patient as compared to photon techniques and the finite range of the proton beam. The latter adds an additional degree of freedom to treatment planning. The range in tissue is associated with considerable uncertainties caused by imaging, patient setup, beam delivery and dose calculation. Reducing the uncertainties would allow a reduction of the treatment volume and thus allow a better utilization of the advantages of protons. This paper summarizes the role of Monte Carlo simulations when aiming at a reduction of range uncertainties in proton therapy. Differences in dose calculation when comparing Monte Carlo with analytical algorithms are analyzed as well as range uncertainties due to material constants and CT conversion. Range uncertainties due to biological effects and the role of Monte Carlo for in vivo range verification are discussed. Furthermore, the current range uncertainty recipes used at several proton therapy facilities are revisited. We conclude that a significant impact of Monte Carlo dose calculation can be expected in complex geometries where local range uncertainties due to multiple Coulomb scattering will reduce the accuracy of analytical algorithms. In these cases Monte Carlo techniques might reduce the range uncertainty by several mm.}

In this paper, we outline the IPbus control system architecture, and describe recent developments in the reliability, scalability and performance of IPbus systems, carried out in preparation for deployment of μTCA-based CMS upgrades before the LHC 2015 run.

abstract = {Cancer therapy is a multi-modality approach including surgery, systemic or targeted chemotherapy, radiation (external beam or radionuclide), and immunotherapy. Radiation is typically administered using external beam photon therapy. Proton therapy has been around for more than 60 years but was restricted to research laboratories until the 1990s. Since then clinical proton therapy has been growing rapidly with currently more than 50 facilities worldwide. The interest in proton therapy stems from the physical properties of protons allowing for advanced dose sculpting around the target and sparing of healthy tissue. This review first evaluates the basics of proton therapy physics and technology and then outlines some of the current physical, biological, and clinical challenges. Solving these will ultimately determine whether proton therapy will continue on its path to becoming mainstream.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses how the substantial differences exist among the mechanisms contributing to the reliability of software and hardware. The reliability of a measurement system is defined as the ability of the system to perform its required function within specified working conditions for a stated period of time. Unfortunately, factors such as manufacturing tolerances in an instrument and varying operating conditions conspire to make the faultless operating life of a system impossible to predict. In quantifying reliability for a measurement system, an immediate difficulty that arises is defining what counts as a fault. Total loss of a measurement output is an obvious fault, but a fault that causes a finite but incorrect measurement is more difficult to identify. The mean time between failures a parameter that expresses the average time between faults occurring in an instrument, calculated over a given period of time. The mean time to failure is an alternative way of quantifying reliability that is normally used for devices such as thermocouples that are discarded when they fail.}
